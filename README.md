# Learning React
These are my React projects that I created while following the [React course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

## Tenzies

A simple and fun dice game built with React. The goal is to roll until all ten dice are the same. Click a die to freeze it at its current value between rolls.
