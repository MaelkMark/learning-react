# Assembly: Endgame
This is a simple hangman-style game where a programming language is deleted with every wrong guess, until only Assembly remains. Guess the word in 8 attempts to keep the programmming world safe from Assembly!

## About The Project

I made this game following the [React course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e]) on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home). I remade it from scratch to make sure I understand everything. I also added a bonus features: you can type with your keyboard too, not only with the on-screen keyboard.

You can compare my solution with the [final result in the course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e/~02el/).
